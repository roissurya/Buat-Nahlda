        <p class="teks">Hi? Umm… its kinda weird for me to make something like this tho but hell yeah ill do it 😌 where should i start? Let’s start from how we met.
            <br>
            <br>
            We went to a same elementary school but at that time, we weren’t close, i mean when we met we only said ‘hi’ to each other and of course thats for politeness haha, but then few years later, we went to a same jhs again, we were on a different class so i didn’t expect that we will be friends even best friends(?) at all. And in 2018, FABT opened a recruitment and this is where it all begins.
            <br>
            <br>
            We applied for it, we did all the selections and shortly after we’re recruited 🙌 and fabt has a daily program named “lapak baca” and its held every saturday. U didn’t have someone to pick u up and take u to there also u know that im a good rider since jhs right haha on the top of that i asked u bout going together and im being ur unofficial rider HAHAHA (actually idk how it started but lets just assume that the story’s like that😭 sorry😭) 
            <br>
            <br>
            Long story short, we became close, and do u remember that freak pensi? When i was starring as sherina😭 u were the narator right? We always did practice for it so MAYBE it makes us closer than before and of course i was still ur rider 😎 and also we had a group chat for that drama, but after the drama ended, everyone left the group except these 8 freak people (fita was leaving too😭 but she joined again later haha) and we became closer closer closer then ever. After we graduated from school, we (scenario) still hangout together. Whenever u say “ada film baruku” the next day we gather at my house to watch that movie😭 we did it regularly for a long period until the online school’s over and i need to go to mks, a day before i went to mks, u guys came to my house to say bye to me and u know whats the funniest thing? u cried hahaha U CRIED 🤣 ik ur love for me is big tho but sorry i dont love u, my love is only for isyana and kkura😍 
            <br>
            <br>
            2022, it was june, u sent me a picture about YIF and asked me to go together, and i was like sure why not (since its my first time to go abroad aswell) we discussed about our passport, where will we stay in jkt, our transport from mks to jkt and everything but ended up we went to jakarta with my mom and cousin😭 we traveled abroad together, of course with anak2 BIS 2 HO A HO E wkwk, it was so fun, we sat next to each other in the bus, and something amazing happened wkwk when we about to go to thailand, we went to lapangan merdeka first right? i was sleeping in the bus so i couldn’t go out but u could, surprisingly u didn’t go out and stayed in the bus cuz u worried about me 😌 sorry 🥲 that’s the sweetest thing u’ve ever done to me 🥹 thanks tho🥹 after that we went back to mks just by 2 of us wkwkwk we were so brave, weren’t we?
            <br>
            <br>
            Anw thats all our story, happy birthday to u, enjoy ur 18, all the best wishes for u, bye.</p>
